# Mr Robot CTF

The Mr Robot boot2root was created to feel like a hack from the series Mr Robot.  In this we will be attacking a webserver to gain access to the machine as a normal user and then from there we will escalate our privileges.  Throughout these steps are 3 keys we will need to find.  You can find the Mr Robot machine on Vulnhub using the link below.
