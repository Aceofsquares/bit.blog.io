# Mr Robot CTF

The Mr Robot boot2root was created to feel like a hack from the series Mr Robot.  In this we will be attacking a webserver to gain access to the machine as a normal user and then from there we will escalate our privileges.  Throughout these steps are 3 keys we will need to find.  You can find the Mr Robot machine on Vulnhub using the link below.

## Tools

- **Nmap**  #For portscanning
- **Wfuzz** #For directory bruteforcing and discovery
- **WGet**  #To pull down files off the site.
- **Firefox** #To connect to the website
- **Hydra** #Used for username enumeration and password bruteforcing
- **Terminal** #Used to do everything else

## Wordlists

For this, I used the common.txt file found in Daniel Miessler's Github of collected wordlists.  You can find the file here

[common.txt](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt)

While that wordlist was used for this box, I do recommend just pulling the full repository down.  You can do that via the following git command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists.git
```

You should have a SecLists directory whereever you initiated the clone command.  The wordlists found in this repository are excellent for many different tasks.

## Scanning

To start off, we perform an nmap scan on the target machine to see what ports are open.
The nmap command I used for this box is as follows

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -p- -O -oA mr_robot <ip address>
```

The arguments used are as follows<br/>
|    |    |
|----|----|
**-sC** | Used to automatically perform default scripts on known ports.
**-sV** | Attempt to get the version of the service on a port
**-p-** |Scan all ports.  These will be TCP ports.
**-O**  | Try to determine the operating system.
**-oA** mr_robot | Output results to all types called mr_robot.&lt;extension&gt;
**&lt;ip address&gt;** | The ip address of the target machine. In my case, it was 10.10.148.81.
<br />
This will take time to run so grab a coffee while you wait.

Once finished, the following results I got were

</pre>

We see that ports 80 and 443 are open and port 22 is closed.  We also see the ports return header information about the server, Apache.  We can investigate this using a browser to see what the page looks like.

Open the browser and in the URL bar enter http://&lt;ip address&gt;.  This should take you to a page that looks like a console.

## Website 

Now that we know there is a web site on the target machine I typically do some quick manual investigations, including looking at the source code, clicking any links and buttons, and entering data into fields in order to get a feel for the site.  You can type some commands in the page and it will present some information to you but this is largely a red herring.  The other bit I look at manually are site.xml and robots.txt.  When you open the robots.txt file you'll see 2 files.  One with the first key and another called fsocity.dic.

<!-- Insert screenshot of robots.txt -->

We can use wget here to pull the fsocity.dic file down.  The command used is as follows

```bash
wget http://<ip address>/fsocity.dic
```

You should now have the fsocity.dic file.  We'll need this file later but first we need to figure out where.  That's where wfuzz will come in.

### WFuzz

We will just start a fuzz of the directories on the site using the following command

```bash
wfuzz -u http://<ip address>/FUZZ -w /path/to/common.txt --hc 404,403 -L --oF mr_robot_webscan_common
```

The arguments are as follows

|    |    |
|----|----|
|**-u http://&lt;ip address&gt;/FUZZ** | The url of the web page.  In this case the /FUZZ are the directories we are going to be bruteforcing. |
|**-w /path/to/common.txt** | The wordlist used to replace the /FUZZ in the URL.|
|**--hc 404,403** | Hide any page that returns the status codes 404 and 403. |
|**-L**| Follow any redirects |
|**-oF mr_robot_webscan_common** | Output the results to mr_robot_webscan_common|

The results I got were numerous so I have cut out the less import results.

These results are important because it tells us this site is written using Wordpress.  Furthermore, we now have the login page we want to try logging into.

Navigate to **http://&lt;ip address&gt;/wp-login.php** and you will be presented with a login page (duh).
