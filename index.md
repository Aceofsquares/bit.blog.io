## Welcome to my Github Pages

This is a site where I will be keeping notes on various CTF writeups as well as notes on tools and techniques.  Right now, I do not have anything to post but I will have stuff coming soon.

### Currently Writing

I am currently working on a writeup for the Mr. Robot VM located on <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/mr-robot-1,151/">Vulnhub</a>.  You can also find it on TryHackMe if you have an account.

### Currently Attempting

[**Jeff**](https://tryhackme.com/room/jeff) - He has a blog and we need to hack it.  The goal is to get the information in the user.txt and root.txt file.

## Learning Resources
